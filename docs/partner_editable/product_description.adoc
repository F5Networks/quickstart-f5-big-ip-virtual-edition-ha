This Quick Start deploys a highly available cluster of two BIG-IP VE instances provisioned with:

* *https://www.f5.com/products/big-ip-services/local-traffic-manager[Local Traffic Manager (LTM)]* - which performs uniform resource identifier (URI)
routing, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption, TCP optimization and automatic discovery of automatically
scaled web applications
* *https://www.f5.com/products/security/advanced-waf[Application Security Manager (ASM)]* - a best of breed web application firewall to help protect against:
** *Automated attacks and bots* - Automated attacks and bots can overwhelm application resources.
** *Credential theft*  - Attacks that steal application credentials or take advantage of compromised accounts.
** *Attacks on mobile clients* - Bots that target browser-based and mobile clients.    
** *Application-layer attacks* - Application-layer attacks can evade signature and reputation-based security solutions.
** *Web app and API attacks* - New attack surfaces and threats due to the rapid adoption of APIs.
** *Targeted attack campaigns* - Active attack campaigns are difficult to detect from singular attacks.

You can customize this Quick Start by changing the configuration parameters. The Quick
Start deploys either a full working stack (network, bastion host and BIG-IP solution) or just the BIG-IP solution into an existing network that you can inspect and use as a reference.
