=== Subscribe to the {partner-product-short-name} AMI

This Quick Start requires a subscription to the AMI for {partner-product-short-name} in AWS Marketplace.

. Sign in to your AWS account.
. {marketplace_listing_url}[Open the page for the {partner-product-short-name} AMI in AWS Marketplace], and then choose *Continue to Subscribe*.
. Review the terms and conditions for software usage, and then choose *Accept Terms*. +
  A confirmation page loads, and an email confirmation is sent to the account owner. For detailed subscription instructions, see the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/help/200799470[AWS Marketplace documentation^].

. When the subscription process is complete, exit out of AWS Marketplace without further action. *Do not* provision the software from AWS Marketplace—the Quick Start deploys the AMI for you.

===  Create a http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[key pair] in your preferred Region.

To do this, in the navigation pane of the Amazon EC2 console, choose *Key Pairs*, *Create Key Pair*, type a name, and then choose *Create*.

Amazon EC2 uses public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information. To be able to log in to your instances, you must create a key pair. With Windows instances, we use the key pair to obtain the administrator password via the Amazon EC2 console and then log in using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as explained in the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair[step-by-step instructions] in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.

=== If necessary, https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-[request a service limit increase] for the Amazon EC2 *m5.2xlarge* instance type.

To do this, in the AWS Support Center, choose *Create Case*, *Service Limit Increase*, *EC2 instances*, and then complete the fields in the limit increase form, as shown in Figure 4. The current default limit is 20 instances.
+
You might need to request an increase if you already have an existing deployment that uses this instance type, and you think you might exceed the default limit with this reference deployment. It might take a few days for the new service limit to become effective. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html[Amazon EC2 Service Limits] in the AWS documentation.

*Note* The Quick Start uses five Elastic IP addresses by default: two for the NAT gateways, two for the proxies, and one for the RD Gateway instance. The default limit for Elastic IP addresses is five per AWS Region. If you’re planning to deploy multiple RD Gateway instances by configuring the *Number of RDGW Hosts* parameter, we recommend that you also request an increase in the Elastic IP address limit: In the https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-[AWS Support Center], choose *Create Case*, *Service Limit Increase*, *Elastic IPs*, and then complete the fields.
