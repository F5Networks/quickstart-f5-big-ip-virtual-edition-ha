*default parameters* builds the following _{partner-product-name}_ environment in the
AWS Cloud.

Figure 1: Quick Start architecture for _{partner-product-name}_ on AWS

As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*

In the public subnets:

* Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
* The public facing NICs of a clustered pair of BIG-IP instances 

In the private subnets:
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram.

* The management NICs of a clustered pair of BIG-IP instances (an out-of-band management network)
* An example application 

Additional Cloud Resources:

* An IAM Role and Instance Profile
* An S3 Bucket used to provide Failover State.

The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips
the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC
configuration.
